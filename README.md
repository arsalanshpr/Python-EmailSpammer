# EmailSpoofer
An email spammer made by a novice programmer.

### Why I made this
I thought it was a cool project to start with.

#### I recommend the NoGui version since I created the gui with tkinter as a rookie/novice.

### Command-line version
EmailSpammerCMD.py {your email} {password} {smtp server(smtp.gmail.com:587)} {reciever email} {message (in quotes)} {amount}

#### smtpserver:
- gmail: smtp.gmail.com:587
- yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com:465
- hotmail: smtp-mail.outlook.com:587
- outlook: smtp.live.com:587
