[Email Spammer Gui Download](https://cdn.rawgit.com/kres0345/EmailSpoofer/ee176011/Email%20spoofer.py) -|- [Executable](https://cdn.rawgit.com/kres0345/EmailSpoofer/caf7f3f1/executables/Email%20spoofer.exe)

Advantage of executable is you don't need to download python
#### I recommend the NoGui and command-line version since I created the gui with tkinter as a rookie/novice.

### Command-line version
EmailSpammerCMD.py {your email} {password} {smtp server(smtp.gmail.com:587)} {reciever email} {message (in quotes)} {amount}

#### SMTP servers:
- gmail: smtp.gmail.com:587
- yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com:465
- hotmail: smtp-mail.outlook.com:587
- outlook: smtp.live.com:587

### Why I made this
I thought it was a cool project.
